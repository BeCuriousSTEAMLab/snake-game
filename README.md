Features
Rainbow-colored snake that grows as it eats food.

Speed increases as the snake eats more food.
Screen wrapping, where the snake reappears on the opposite side when it goes out of bounds.

How to Play

Eat the food to grow longer.
Avoid running into the snake's own body.
The game ends when the snake collides with itself.
